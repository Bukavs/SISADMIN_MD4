  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
#  push:
#    branches: [ "main" ]
#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
#jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
